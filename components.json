      "description": "A convolution operation applies a matrix dot product to the input matrix using a kernel matrix. \r\nThe kernel matrix is then shifted horizontal along the input matrix by stride pixels to compute the next overlapping matrix dot product",

    "MaxPool": {
      "description": "MaxPool simply returns the maximum scalar value within typically a square area of a particular size \r\n from the input. This causes the size of the output to be scaled down by a factor. For instance, a maxpool over a \r\n size of 4x4 reduces the output by a factor of 4, with respect to the input",
